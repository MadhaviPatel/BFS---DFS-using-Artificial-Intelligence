# BFS---DFS-using-Artificial-Intelligence
Compare two algorithm BGS and DFS
Artificial Intelligence 
  • Create new environment
• Run code cell by cell
Idea
A start word and an end word are given. Change the start word into the end word in order to have a successful search for changing the word from start to end.
We perform two algorithm BFS and DFS
BFS
BFS stands for Breadth First Search. BFS reaches a vertex with the fewest number of edges from a source vertex, it can be used to find single source shortest path in an unweighted graph. BFS is better at finding vertices that are close to the given source. BFS prioritises all neighbours, making it unsuitable for decision-making trees in games or puzzles. BFS has a time complexity of O(V + E) when using an Adjacency List and O(V2) when using an Adjacency Matrix, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.
   
DFS
The Stack data structure is used by DFS (Depth First Search). To get from a source vertex to a destination vertex in DFS, we may have to traverse through more edges. DFS has a time complexity of O(V + E) when using an Adjacency List and O(V2) when using an Adjacency Matrix, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.
If we compare two algorithm we get better result DFS. It is taking less time to give output
